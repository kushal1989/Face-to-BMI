# ðŸ§  Face-to-BMI: AI-Powered Body Mass Index Prediction

**Face-to-BMI** is a deep learning application that estimates an individual's Body Mass Index (BMI) using facial images. Leveraging a pre-trained EfficientNetV2 model, this tool provides real-time BMI predictions via live camera feed or uploaded images. It also offers personalized health insights and maintains a user-specific BMI history.

## ðŸ§  Model Training

The BMI prediction model was trained on the [Illinois DOC Labeled Faces Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/davidjfisher/illinois-doc-labeled-faces-dataset), which contains over 68,000 labeled mugshots. The dataset includes both frontal and side-profile images, each annotated with metadata such as date of birth and name, making it ideal for training facial recognition models.

To train the model:

1. Run `EfficientNetV2.py` to train the model.
2. After training, you will receive a file named `Optimized_EfficientNetV2_Model.keras`. 
3. Replace the `model_path` in `app.py` with the path to this saved model file:

    ```python
    model_path = r"C:\path\to\your\Optimized_EfficientNetV2_Model.keras"

## ðŸ“Š BMI Classification Categories
- **Underweight**: BMI < 18.5  
  - *Advice*: Consider consuming a nutrient-rich diet with more calories and engaging in strength-building exercises.
- **Normal**: 18.5 â‰¤ BMI < 25  
  - *Advice*: Maintain your current lifestyle with a balanced diet and regular physical activity.
- **Overweight**: 25 â‰¤ BMI < 30  
  - *Advice*: Incorporate more physical activity into your routine and consider reducing high-calorie food intake.
- **Obese**: BMI â‰¥ 30  
  - *Advice*: Consult a healthcare provider for a tailored weight-loss plan, including diet and exercise.
